# Guru Vaani - AI-Powered Teacher Reflection Platform

Guru Vaani is a comprehensive platform designed to empower teachers through AI-assisted reflection and provide administrators with actionable insights into educational trends.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo with the following packages:

- **`backend`**: Node.js/Express server using Prisma (SQLite) for data persistence and authentication.
- **`teacher-web-app`**: sleek, mobile-first React application for teachers to submit reflections (text/voice).
- **`web-dashboard`**: Admin interface for viewing analytics, managing teachers, and monitoring reflections.
- **`shared`**: Common UI components, design tokens, and utilities shared between frontends.

## 🚀 Getting Started

    ```

### Running the Platform
To start all services (Backend, Teacher App, Admin Dashboard) concurrently:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or run them individually:

npm run build
cd ..
```

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

Both the Teacher App and Admin Dashboard are configured for Vercel deployment.

**Teacher Web App:**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Set Root Directory: `teacher-web-app`
4. Add Environment Variable: `VITE_API_URL` (your backend URL)
5. Deploy

**Admin Dashboard:**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Set Root Directory: `web-dashboard`
4. Add Environment Variable: `VITE_API_URL` (your backend URL)
5. Deploy

### Backend Deployment (Render)

The backend is configured for Render deployment via `render.yaml`.

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Create a new Web Service in Render
3. Connect your repository
4. Render will auto-detect `render.yaml`
5. Set the following environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL`: Your production database URL
   - `FRONTEND_URL`: Your deployed frontend URL(s)
   - `GROK_API_KEY`: Your Grok API key (if using AI features)
